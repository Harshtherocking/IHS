### Case 
Bharat Engineering Works Limited is a major industrial machineries besides other engineering products. It has enjoyed market
preference for its machineries because of limited competition in the field. Usually there have been more orders than what the company could supply.
However, the scenario changed quickly because of the entry of two new competitors in the field with foreign technological collaboration. For the
first time, the company faced problem in marketing its products with usual profit margin. Sensing the likely problem, the chief executive appointed Mr
Arvind Kumar as general manager to direct the operations of industrial machinery division. Mr Kumar had similar assignment abroad before
coming back to India. Mr Kumar had a discussion with the chief executive about the nature of the problem being faced by the company so that he
could fix up his priority. The chief executive advised him to consult various heads of department to have first hand information. However, he
emphasised that the company lacked an integrated planning system while members of the Board of Directors insisted on introducing this in several
meetings both formally and informally. After joining as General Manager, Mr Kumar got briefings from the heads of all departments. He asked all
heads to identify major problems and issues concerning them. The marketing manager indicated that in order to achieve higher sales, he
needed more sales support. Sales people had no central organisation to provide sales support nor was there a generous budget for demonstration
teams which could be sent to customers to win business. The production manager complained about the old machines and equipments used in
manufacturing. Therefore, cost of production was high but without corresponding quality. While competitors had better equipments and
machinery, Bharat Engineering had neither replaced its age-old plant nor reconditioned it. Therefore to reduced the cost, it was essential to automate
production lines by installing new equipment. Director of research and development did not have specific problem and therefore, did not indicate
for any change. However, a principal scientist in R&D indicated on one day that the director of R&D, though very nice in his approach, did not
emphasize on short-term research projects, which could easily increase production efficiency by at least 20 per cent within a very short period
without any major capital outlay.

### Question 1
Discuss the nature and characteristics of the problems in this case.
### Answer 1
The case of Bharat Engineering Works Limited highlights several challenges the company is facing due to increased competition and outdated practices. Let's analyze the nature and characteristics of the problems:
- Increased Competition:
The entry of two new competitors with foreign technological collaboration has intensified competition. This has led to a decrease in market preference for Bharat Engineering's products and a decline in profit margins.
- Outdated Infrastructure:
The production manager highlighted the issue of old machines and equipment, leading to high production costs and lower quality products compared to competitors. There is a need to modernize and automate production lines to remain competitive.
- Lack of Sales Support:
The marketing manager pointed out the lack of a central organization for sales support and insufficient budget for demonstration teams. This affects the company's ability to effectively market and sell its products.
-Absence of Integrated Planning System:
The company lacks an integrated planning system, as emphasized by the Board of Directors. This hampers coordination and decision-making across departments, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.
- Underutilization of R&D Potential:
The R&D department is not focusing on short-term research projects that could significantly increase production efficiency without major capital outlay. There is a need to align R&D efforts with short-term goals to drive immediate improvements.

### Question 2
What steps should be taken by Mr Kumar to overcome these problems?
- Develop an Integrated Planning System:
Implement a comprehensive planning system that facilitates coordination and communication across departments. This would ensure alignment with organizational goals and efficient resource allocation.
- Modernize Production Facilities:
Invest in upgrading and automating production lines to improve efficiency and product quality. This may involve replacing old machinery and equipment with state-of-the-art technology.
- Enhance Sales Support:
Allocate sufficient resources to establish a central organization for sales support and increase the budget for demonstration teams. This would enable the marketing team to effectively promote products and win business.
- Revise R&D Strategy:
Encourage the R&D department to focus on short-term research projects aimed at enhancing production efficiency. Emphasize the importance of innovation and continuous improvement to maintain competitiveness.
- Employee Training and Development:
Provide training and development opportunities to employees to enhance their skills and adapt to changing market dynamics. This would foster a culture of innovation and excellence within the organization.
